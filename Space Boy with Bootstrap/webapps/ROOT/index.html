      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>Space Boy was born in the distant year of 4580. Humanity has colonized all
        of the habitable planets in the Milky Way Galaxy, and space travel is incredibly advanced.
        At a young age, Space Boy set out on his own and accidentally got sucked into a wormhole! He woke up
        in our present time. Space Boy discovered the only planet with humans at the time, Earth, and has made
        a life for himself there helping his ancestors with their problems.</p>
      <p>While Space Boy can't speak the ancient dialect of these early Earthlings, his suit is equipped
      with a universal translator, so he can at least understand them. He wears his suit everywhere he goes
      in order to understand what people are saying, which turns more than a few heads. Space Boy travels the
      whole planet helping people, but has taken a particular liking to Cityville, so that's where he spends
      most of his time. He uses his high-tech gadgets to help make our lives easier! From teleportation to holograms to what
      our primitive eyes may consider to be <em>magic</em>; nothing is impossible with Space Boy!</p>
