  <h4>Hobbies</h4>
  <p>Space Boy has become fairly well acquainted with Ancient Earth customs, and has taken up several hobbies since his arrival:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>He made a version of the old "jump rope" he kept seeing kids of this time play with: the <strong>Laser Jump Rope</strong>. It's all the fun
    of jump rope without getting tripped by the rope! Instead, there's a harmless laser that detects if you've made contact with it. <em>Technology!</em></li>
    <li>He has also taken an incredible liking to Peanut Butter flavored ice cream. He had never
      experienced the flavor of peanuts (peanuts were erased from the timeline after the 23rd Century, of course), and
      he never ceases to be perplexed and delighted by it.</li>
    <li>He generally loves sightseeing, as well as taking pictures of the places he's been and the friends he's made along the way.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Prized Possessions</h4>
  <p>Space Boy has collected many things that he keeps aboard his home ship, the Tanz-23. At night, he'll look through his collections
  and reminisce on the many adventures he's had through life. Some of these things include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>His three Science Fair First Place Ribbons (after his third year at Earth school, he had to stop
      attending these competitions out of fairness to the Ancient Earth students).</li>
    <li>His bottomless ice-cream cone of his own design, which always refills itself with cold, delicious ice cream when emptied.</li>
    <li>A holo-image of him and his parents, one of the few remnants of life before travelling to the past.</li>
  </ul>
