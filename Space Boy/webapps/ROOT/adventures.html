  <h3>Adventures</h3>

  <p>Space Boy is always staying busy! You can almost always find him helping someone
  around Cityville, with whatever problem they may be facing. There's no problem too big
  or too small for Space Boy!</p>
  <h4>Saving Suzie's Cat</h4>
  <p>One day, as Space Boy was walking through the Cityville Park taking in the sights, he
  saw his friend Suzie from Earth school anxiously eyeing a tall tree. As Space Boy approached,
  Suzie's eyes met with his and he felt in her gaze the panic she was experiencing.</p>
  <p><span id="suzie">"Space Boy! I'm so glad you're here,"</span> she said, frantically trying to get her words out.
    <span id="suzie">"My cat, Jerome, has been up in this tree for the last 20 minutes! I've called his name a million
      times but he just won't come down. Would you mind helping me out?"</span>
      Space Boy looked up at this large cat clinging to a thin branch near the
    top of the tree, pondering what the most efficient way to get him down would be.</p>
  <p><em>Suddenly, an idea!</em> Space Boy powered up his jetpack and flew off as fast as he could
    towards his ship, Tanz-23, which he always leaves cloaked over the city. He rummaged through his things momentarily until he found it:
  The <strong>Nucleoid Matter PhaseShifter 4000&#x2122;.</strong>
  Space Boy was back in a flash: he set up his old PhaseShifter on the ground below the tree, and targeted its systems on the branch
  that Jerome was still firmly clawed onto. Once he was certain he had locked on, Space Boy started the machine and <em>WOOSH!</em>
  In an instant, Jerome and the branch he clung to both disappeared from sight in the tree, simultaneously appearing on the ground
  directly in front of Suzie. Every hair of Jerome's fur coat stood perfectly straight, and the poor feline sat wide-eyed trying to comprehend its
  sudden change of location.</p>
  <p>Suzie squealed with delight, wrapping her arms around Jerome. <span id="suzie">
    "Thank you so much, Space Boy,"</span> she said, <span id="suzie">"Jerome and I both really appreciate it!"</span></p>
  <p>As Suzie carried a still dazed Jerome back home, Space Boy felt accomplished in doing another good deed. As he packed up his
  Nucleoid Matter PhaseShifter 4000&#x2122; and prepared to fly back home, it occurred to him that he could have simply
  flown up to Jerome in the tree and retrieved him much more quickly. Space Boy still feels slightly embarassed that he didn't think
  of that to this day, and is in a perpetual state of fear regarding what to say if Suzie ever asks him why he didn't just do that.</p>

  <h4>The Coolest Bike on the Block</h4>
  <p>Space Boy was strolling through the suburbs of Cityville. He had just bought some ice cream using the strange paper currency
  of this era (in his childhood, the currency of the Galactic Human Federation was <em>lasers</em>, stored in
  a 4-dimensional multi-refractive wallet). As he was enjoying his treat, he saw several children whizzing by on
  their bicycles. Space Boy was impressed with how much speed they could gather, even through such rudimentary tools as wheels and human power alone.</p>
  <p>Space Boy was so distracted with the bikes that he almost didn't see
    young Jimmy sitting on the curb, looking quite forlorn. Space Boy sat next to Jimmy to see if there was anything he could do.
    <span id="jimmy">"Oh hey, Space Boy. I didn't see you there,"</span> Jimmy said, sitting slightly taller. Jimmy continued,
    <span id="jimmy">"Knowing you, you're probably wondering why I'm so bummed."</span> Space Boy smiled from behind his helmet and nodded.</p>
  <p>Jimmy smiled, <span id="jimmy">"Thanks. I'm just upset. <em>My</em> bike broke about a week ago. The whole front tire flew
    off while I was trying to jump that ramp over there,"</span> he pointed to a small, wooden ramp that was currently in use by
  all the other neighborhood kids.<span id="jimmy">"We don't have enough money to fix it,
    so now all I can do is watch the other guys ride their bikes."</span></p>
  <p>Space Boy sat and listened to Jimmy for a while longer, silently absorbing all of Jimmy's grievances. Once it started getting dark out,
  Jimmy thanked him again for listening, and they both waved goodbye for the night. But, Space Boy did very little sleeping that night, or
  for the next two nights for that matter. He stayed in his ship, the Tanz-23, and thought and tinkered and built the <em>perfect bike</em>.
  This bike had it all:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>High-Durability, Dual-Magnetic Hover Wheels,</li>
    <li>A state-of-the-art Tritanium Frame (that's 3x stronger than Titanium!),</li>
    <li>Complete Gyroscopic Balance Stabilizers, and of course,</li>
    <li>A cool sounding bell, tightly fastened to the handlebars.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When Space Boy finally brought his masterpiece to the neighborhood,
  every kid on the block came out to see its perfection; Space Boy was very proud of his work.
  Jimmy was ecstatic when he received the gift, and promised that Space Boy now always
  has first dibs on any of Jimmy's best lunch snacks at the Earth school. Space Boy spent the rest of that
  afternoon sitting with the other kids answering questions about the bike's construction
  with diagrams they couldn't begin to understand, all the while watching Jimmy fly off the wooden ramp with glee.</p>
