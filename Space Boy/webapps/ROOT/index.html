  <h3>Biography</h3>
  <p>Space Boy was born in the distant year of 4580. Humanity has colonized all
    of the habitable planets in the Milky Way Galaxy, and space travel is incredibly advanced.
    At a young age, Space Boy set out on his own and accidentally got sucked into a wormhole! He woke up
    in our present time. Space Boy discovered the only planet with humans at the time, Earth, and has made
    a life for himself there helping his ancestors with their problems.</p>
  <p>While Space Boy can't speak the ancient dialect of these early Earthlings, his suit is equipped
  with a universal translator, so he can at least understand them. He wears his suit everywhere he goes
  in order to understand what people are saying, which turns more than a few heads. Space Boy travels the
  whole planet helping people, but has taken a particular liking to Cityville, so that's where he spends
  most of his time. He uses his high-tech gadgets to help make our lives easier! From teleportation to holograms to what
  our primitive eyes may consider to be <em>magic</em>; nothing is impossible with Space Boy!</p>
